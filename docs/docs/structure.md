# Structure

Like we said in Intro, we followed Laravel a bit.

So, we do have following folders:

- app
  - controllers (No wonder there)
  - functions (Anything which we think can be reused, abstracted - Go crazy with this one)
  - middlewares (We tried, you can't blame us)
  - models (All sequelize related stuff)
  - requests (You might like this, all validations happen here)
  - responses (Not very magical, but helps you put together)
